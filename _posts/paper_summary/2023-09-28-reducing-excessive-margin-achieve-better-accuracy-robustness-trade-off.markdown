### Comprehension
<font size="4">
What is the research problem the paper attempts to address?<br>
  While adversarial training is known to be a method to protect models against adversarial attacks, it is known to reduce the accuracy. This paper attempts to address this robustness-accuracy tradeoff, which has been postulated by previous works, that they are at odds with one another.
What are the claimed contributions of the paper?<br>
How do the authors substantiate their claims?<br>
What are the conclusions?
