### Comprehension
<font size="4">
<ins>What is the research problem the paper attempts to address?</ins><br>
  <font size="3.5">
  While adversarial training is known to be a method to protect models against adversarial attacks, it is known to reduce the accuracy. This paper attempts to address this robustness-accuracy tradeoff, which has been postulated by previous works, that they are at odds with one another.<br>
  </font>
<ins>What are the claimed contributions of the paper?</ins><br>
  <font size="3.5">
  The paper attempts to address the research problem by studying the effects of adversarial training ("<em>examin[ing] the changes induced in the decision boundary of a deep network during adversarial training</em>"). They claim that adversarial training causes "<em>unwarranted increase in the margin along certain adversarial directions</em>" which leads to lower accuracy. The main claimed contribution of this paper is the new algorithm <em>Helper-based Adversarial Training (HAT)</em> which provides better robustness without sacrificing the accuracy compared to existing adversarial defense<br>
