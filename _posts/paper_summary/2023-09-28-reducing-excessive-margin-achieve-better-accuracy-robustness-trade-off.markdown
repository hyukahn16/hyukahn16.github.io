### Comprehension
<font size="4">
<ins>What is the research problem the paper attempts to address?</ins><br>
  <font size="3.5">
  While adversarial training is known to be a method to protect models against adversarial attacks, it is known to reduce the accuracy. This paper attempts to address this robustness-accuracy tradeoff, which has been postulated by previous works, that they are at odds with one another.<br>
