<b>Claim (1):</b>  Adversarial training causes the decision boundaries of the network to shift unncessarily far in the adversarial direction.<br><br>
Using CIFAR-10 and ResNet-18 (94.6% accuracy, 0% robustness to PGD L-inf attacks) fine-tuned with adversarial training (83.3% accuracy, 51.6% robustness), the authors first show that the network overfits or accounts excessively for the initial adversarial training directions as show in the graph below.
