The paper attempts to address the research problem by studying the effects of adversarial training ("<em>examin[ing] the changes induced in the decision boundary of a deep network during adversarial training</em>"). They claim that (1) adversarial training causes "<em>unwarranted increase in the margin along certain adversarial directions</em>" which leads to lower accuracy. The main claimed contribution of this paper is the (2) new algorithm <em>Helper-based Adversarial Training (HAT)</em> which provides better robustness without sacrificing the accuracy compared to existing adversarial defense.
