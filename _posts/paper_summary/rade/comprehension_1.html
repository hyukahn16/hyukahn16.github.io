The paper attempts to address the research problem by studying the effects of adversarial training ("examin[ing] the changes induced in the decision boundary of a deep network during adversarial training"). They claim that (1) adversarial training causes "unwarranted increase in the margin along certain adversarial directions" which leads to lower accuracy. The main claimed contribution of this paper is the (2) new algorithm Helper-based Adversarial Training (HAT) which provides better robustness without sacrificing the accuracy compared to existing adversarial defenses.
