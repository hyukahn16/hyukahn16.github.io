<!-- Are the contributions significant? -->

<em>Disclaimer: This is the first paper I read talking about decision boundaries and its effect in adversarial robustness. I'm not sure whether the contribution is significant with respect to other research done in this area of adversarial training and decision boundary (margin) analysis.</em>

Because of the disclaimer above, I will talk about the significance of the contribution with respect to what I know.
<br>
The contributions are definitely significant to me. 
I think there are two significant contributions. 
First is the analysis done on the impact of adversarial training through the adversarial fine-tuning epoch. 
Second is the Helper-based Adversarial Training algorithm developed to help alleviate the robustness-accuracy margin problem that derives from adversarial training.

<em>I think I need to look more into the algorithm...</em>

<em>Include picture of the HAT algorithm here!</em>
