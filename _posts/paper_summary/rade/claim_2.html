<b>Claim (3):</b>  Pushing the decision boundary only slightly achieves enough robustness (while maintaining accuracy). New algorithm called "Helper-based Adversarial Training" (HAT) provides better robustness without sacrificing the accuracy compared to existing adversarial defenses.<br><br>
The effect of <em>Helper-based Adversarial Training (HAT)</em> is claimed through experimental results that compare the accuracy and robustness of the networks adversarially trained with HAT and 3 other adversarial training methods.<br><br>
