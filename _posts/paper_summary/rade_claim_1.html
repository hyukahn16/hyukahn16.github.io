<b>Claim (2):</b>  <em>"The drastic rise in the margin along the initial adversarial training direction is directly correlated to the observed reduction in accuracy."</em><br><br>
Using an adversarially fine-tuned network (trained on CIFAR-10) using TRADES with various robustness-accuracy trade-off variable. As this variable was increased in the experiment, the margin also increased in the direction of the initial adversarial direction along with increased reduction in accuracy.<br><br>
