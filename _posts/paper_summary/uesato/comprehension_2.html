<b>Claim (1):</b>  Adversarial training induces a significant decrease in the curvature of the decision boundary and the loss landscape in the input space.
<br><br>
Claim 1 substantiation
<br><br>

<b>Claim (2):</b> Existience of upper and lower bounds of robustness indicate that curvature minimization and robustness are correlated.
<br><br>
Claim 2 substantiation
<br><br>


<b>Claim (3):</b> New <em>efficient</em> regularization technique that mimicks the effect of adversarial training (the curvature minimization).
<br><br>
Claim 3 substantiation
