<b>Claim (1):</b>  Adversarial training induces a significant decrease in the curvature of the decision boundary and the loss landscape in the input space.<br>
<em>(Q: How do you study the loss landscape in the input space?)</em>
<br><br>
<b>Claim (2):</b> There exists upper and lower bounds of the network's robustness towards adversarial perturbations with respect to the curvature of the loss.
These bounds indicate that curvature minimization and robustness are correlated.
<br><br>
<b>Claim (3):</b> New <em>efficient</em> regularization technique that mimicks the effect of adversarial training (the curvature minimization),
which leads to more robust network that is comparable to the performance of adversarial training.
